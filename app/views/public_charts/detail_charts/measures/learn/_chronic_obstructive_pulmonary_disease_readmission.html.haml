    Your hospitalâ€™s 30-day chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)
    readmission rate is the percentage of Medicare patients discharged from your
    hospital with a principal diagnosis of COPD who are readmitted for any cause
    within 30-days. Selected planned readmissions are excluded.

    The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program encourages hospitals to decrease
    readmissions rates. CMS believes that COPD patients who receive high quality
    care during their hospitalizations and their transition to the outpatient
    setting will likely have improved outcomes and lower readmission rates.
