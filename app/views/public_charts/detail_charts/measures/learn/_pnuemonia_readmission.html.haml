    Your hospitalâ€™s 30-day pneumonia readmission rate is the percentage of
    Medicare patients discharged from your hospital with a principal diagnosis
    of pneumonia who are readmitted for any cause within 30-days.
    Selected planned readmissions are excluded.

    The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program encourages hospitals to decrease
    readmissions rates. CMS believes that pneumonia patients who receive high
    quality care during their hospitalizations and their transition to the
    outpatient setting will likely have improved outcomes and lower
    readmission rates.
