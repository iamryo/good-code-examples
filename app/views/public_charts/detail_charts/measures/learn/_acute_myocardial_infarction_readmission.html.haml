    Your hospitalâ€™s 30-day acute myocardial infarction (AMI) readmission rate is
    the percentage of Medicare patients discharged from your hospital with a
    principal diagnosis of AMI who are readmitted for any cause within 30-days.
    Selected planned readmissions are excluded.

    The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program encourages hospitals to decrease
    readmissions rates. CMS believes that AMI patients who receive high quality
    care during their hospitalizations and their transition to the outpatient
    setting will likely have improved outcomes and lower readmission rates.
